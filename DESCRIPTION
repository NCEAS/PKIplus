Description: Provides functions such as verifying certificates, RSA encryption and signing.
    These functions can be used to build Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and perform cryptography 
    related tasks. This package is an extension of the PKI package, with additional methods for 
    accessing meta data from X.509 certificates. The PKI specification can be found at 
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280>. RSA is a cryptography related standard specified at 
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447>.
